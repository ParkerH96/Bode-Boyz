          <p>&emsp;The "Bode Boyz" is a team comprised of 5 students majoring in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science,
            and Computer Engineering at the University of Kentucky. The team members are Andy Conway, Taylor Riggs,
            Parker Householder, -member 4 here-, and -member 5 here-. Our goal for this project is to build a Guitar
            Filter which can amplify and isolate a particular string (E4 at ~330Hz).</p>

          <h1>Progress</h1>
          <p>&emsp;We currently have two possible designs for our circuit after figuring out that our original plan was probably a
          bit more complex then it needed to be. So far from our initial simulations both appear to do exactly what we need them to do.
          However, after spending several hours in one of the circuit labs in FPAT, we could not manage to make either schematic simulation
          a reality. Both circuits, despite being tweaked to perfection, simply did not produce the desired filtration around 330Hz. Instead,
          they didn't even appear to be filtering anything at all.</p>
          <p>&emsp;We have concluded thus far that the two main errors we may be having are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Usage of polarized capacitors for our RLC design. Either we were not using them correctly or we need to use non-polarized instead.
            However, the low capacitance of non-polarized capacitors lead us to our second main issue with resistance.</li>
            <li>Our resistor values, due to the low capacitance, are incredibly high (one being ~9.1MOhms) for our Band Pass Filter design. We are thinking
            that this may be an issue because it is causing an insane amount of extra noise in the circuit making it difficult to read our oscilloscope, let
            alone actually filter out everything but 330Hz.</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>Created github repository for our website</li>
            <li>Found our team logo</li>
            <li>Decided on next meeting for the coming week</li>
            <li>Sent logo out to Dr. Lau</li>
            <li>Established basic roles and started talking about what we would need</li>
            <li>Did some basic research on the project</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Meeting Minutes 4/18</h3>
          <h6>Entire Team</h6>
          <ul>
            <li>Started calculating resistor and capacitor values for our initial design</li>
            <li>We researched the design and decided to start with a Band Reject->Band Pass->Band Reject</li>
            <li>Drew the initial rough sketch of our circuit</li>
            <li>Discussed the difference between pitch and frequencey (Pitch refers to the sound)</li>
            <li>Parts picked out:
              <ul>
                <li>Arduino Uno</li>
                <li>Capacitors: 104M</li>
                <li>1/4" Audio Jack</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Finalized what needed to be done for next meeting and decided on the next meeting date</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Laboratory Minutes 4/19</h3>
          <h6>Andy Conway and Parker Householder</h6>
          <ul>
            <li>Spent several hours in an FPAT circuits lab trying to build a functional prototype</li>
            <li>We ran into several issues when trying to build Circuit I and Circuit II (seen on the left)</li>
            <li>After multiple tries and multiple test builds with no success, we came to the conclusion that we might
               need to use higher capacitance values in the Circuit II schematic</li>
