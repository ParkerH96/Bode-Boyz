          <p>&emsp;The "Bode Boyz" is a team comprised of 5 students majoring in Electrical Engineering, Computer Science,
            and Computer Engineering at the University of Kentucky. The team members are Andy Conway, Taylor Riggs,
            Parker Householder, Braden Vickers, and Tianyi Lyu. Our goal for this project is to build a Guitar
            Filter which can amplify and isolate a particular string (E4 at ~330Hz).</p>

          <h1>Progress</h1>
          <p>&emsp;We currently have two possible designs for our circuit after figuring out that our original plan was probably a
          bit more complex then it needed to be. So far from our initial simulations both appear to do exactly what we need them to do.
          However, after spending several hours in one of the circuit labs in FPAT, we could not manage to make either schematic simulation
          a reality. Both circuits, despite being tweaked to perfection, simply did not produce the desired filtration around 330Hz. Instead,
          they didn't even appear to be filtering anything at all.</p>
          <p>&emsp;We have concluded thus far that the two main errors we may be having are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Usage of polarized capacitors for our RLC design. Either we were not using them correctly or we need to use non-polarized instead.
            However, the low capacitance of non-polarized capacitors lead us to our second main issue with resistance.</li>
            <li>Our resistor values, due to the low capacitance, are incredibly high (one being ~9.1MOhms) for our Band Pass Filter design. We are thinking
            that this may be an issue because it is causing an insane amount of extra noise in the circuit making it difficult to read our oscilloscope, let
            alone actually filter out everything but 330Hz.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>&emsp;When we started our meeting on the 25th of April, we noticed that the original amplification circuit designed on the 21st was no longer operational.
            So we decided to strip the breadboard entirely, build it on a new breadboard, and retest the circuit. After about 30-60 minutes of testing, we managed to get
            the amplifying part of the circuit functional again with the design shown below:</p>

          <p>&emsp;Here is also a freeze frame of the particular wave that our scope is reading from the guitar input:</p>

          <br><br>
          <p>&emsp;Our next step was trying to recreate the filter portion of the circuit to see if we could manage to actually filter out any particular frequencies. We started
           by trying to build a simple high pass filter but the bode plot was flat lining from 50Hz to 1000Hz, which means that the filtration was far from functional.</p>
