	  <center><h3>Regarding pitch and frequency...</h3></center>
	  <p>&emsp;Pitch and frequency are often used interchangeably in the subject of
	    music. There is, however, a dinstinction that must be made when discussing the
	    physics of sound processing. Any object that vibrates in space produces an effect 
	    that can be discerned by its repeated motion back and forth. This motion, when
	    plotted on a graph with respect to time, can be seen as a wave. The number of
	    times a particle of the object completes a back and forth motion per unit of time
	    is what we define as frequency. In physics, we define the unit of Hertz as one
	    vibration, or one complete motion back and forth, per second of time.
	    <br><br>
	    &emsp;Pitch can be defined as a specific frequency at which a musical note can be
	    sensed. In music, the terms note and pitch are synonymous for this reason. We
	    define certain frequencies as musical notes, or pitches. For instance, the
	    frequency 329.6 Hz (Hertz) is defined as the E4 musical note or pitch. Frequency
	    and pitch are one and the same, but to avoid any confusion, we must be sure 
	    to understand their distinctions in the context of sound processing.
